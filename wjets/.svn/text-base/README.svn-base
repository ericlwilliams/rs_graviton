%% wjetsScaleFactors.C %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Loads plot files from ../plots/ctrl_plots/...
Calculates scale factors in
ctrl_lowm: pt(lv)>50, pt(jj)>50, m(jj)<65 || m(jj)>115
ctrl_highm: pt(lv)>200, pt(jj)>200, m(jj)<65 || m(jj)>115
lowsb_lowm: pt(lv)>50, pt(jj)>50, m(jj)<65
highsb_lowm: pt(lv)>50, pt(jj)>50, m(jj)>115
lowsb_highm: pt(lv)>200, pt(jj)>200, m(jj)<65
highsb_highm: pt(lv)>200, pt(jj)>200, m(jj)>115

Error propagation done 'by hand'. To be done via histos?  How to check?

- run with 'sidebands' option for sideband scaleband scale factors
- run with 'ctrl_wjets' for lowm/highm scale factors
  - See logs/wjets_OPTION_sf.csv for scriptable outputs
  
- NOTE: sidebands used combined channels (el/mu) while ctrl_wjets keep separate.

%% wjetsPrint.C %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Loads plot files from ../plots/ctrl_plots/...
- Plots dijet_m distribution for ALPGEN/SHERPA in lowm/highm regions for summed background and data, with data blinded in signal region.  
- To compare ALPGEN/SHERPA sideband scaling in signal region.
